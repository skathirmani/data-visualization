	• Grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic

	• In grammar of graphic, the final graph is like a sentence and the individual components of the graphic are similar to the individual words in the sentence
	• To the understand the individual components of a graphic, let us look at the process that takes to create a scatter plot
